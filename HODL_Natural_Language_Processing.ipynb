input sequence is denoted as $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{\\tau}$. The gray block containing the functions $\\hat{g}$ and $\\hat{h}$ is a neural network that takes two things as input:\n","\n","1.   An element $x_t$ of the sequence\n","2.   A state $s_t$\n","\n","Based on this input, it outputs a prediction $y_t$. We apply this block to every element of the sequence in order. The state $s_t$ is used to encode all necessary information of the input $x_0, \\dots, x_{t-1}$ when we make the prediction for $x_t$. In the beginning, we initialize the state $s_0$ by setting it to all zeros. This state is then passed to the network, together with $x_0$. We then get the prediction $y_0$ and the state $s_1$ that is used for the subsequent evaluation of the same network for the next element in the input sequence $x_1$. This is what we see on the right of the image. Note that all gray blocks are the same network. We just run it again and again (recurrently).
